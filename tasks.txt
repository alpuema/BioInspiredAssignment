# Swarm-Based Traffic Optimization: Development Checklist

This checklist tracks implementation progress for each major module or feature.
**Mark steps as completed (`[x]`) as you work. Add notes or dates as needed.**

## Development Steps

### 1. Define Scope and Objectives
- [x] List all supported optimization objectives.
- [x] Define scenario complexity and key parameters.
- [x] Outline success criteria for optimization and sensitivity analysis.

### 2. Design Project Architecture
- [x] Specify modular components and interfaces.
- [x] Draw data flow and define file/folder structure.

### 3. Implement Configuration Layer
- [x] Create YAML/JSON config files for scenarios, optimizers, and objectives.
- [x] Develop Python config loader with CLI overrides and validation.

### 4. Develop Scenario Generator
- [x] Write code to generate/load traffic networks (grid, etc.).
- [x] Parameterize scenario elements: network size, traffic demand, events.

### 5. Integrate Simulation Engine(s)
- [x] Implement standard Python interface for simulation backends (`sim_interface.py`).
- [x] Add and test SUMO backend (`sumo_engine.py`, `sumo_scenario_builder.py`).
- [ ] Add support for CityFlow or custom backend (optional).
- [ ] Confirm SUMO backend runs scenarios, accepts control params, and outputs metrics.

### 6. Build Swarm Optimizer Module
- [ ] Write modular interfaces for optimizers (`optimizer_interface.py`).
- [ ] Implement at least one algorithm (e.g., PSO).
- [ ] Ensure optimizer can query objective, update solutions, and interact with simulation.

### 7. Implement Objective Function Module
- [ ] Write all supported objective functions (`objectives.py`).
- [ ] Enable dynamic selection of objective via config.
- [ ] Ensure objectives receive simulation results and return scalar fitness.

### 8. Develop Sensitivity Analysis Module
- [ ] Integrate with sensitivity libraries (SALib).
- [ ] Automate repeated optimization runs with parameter sampling.
- [ ] Record results for analysis.

### 9. Results Logging and Visualization
- [ ] Log experiment results to files (CSV, JSON).
- [ ] Implement plotting/visualization (matplotlib/seaborn).
- [ ] Generate reports on optimization and sensitivity findings.

### 10. CLI/Experiment Runner
- [ ] Create main entry point (`cli.py`) for running experiments from config/CLI.
- [ ] Handle scenario setup, optimizer launch, and results collection.

### 11. Testing, Documentation, and Extensibility
- [x] Write unit and integration tests for existing modules.
- [ ] Write tests for new modules as you build.
- [ ] Complete documentation and user instructions (README).
- [ ] Ensure clear API for adding new objectives, optimizers, or backends.

## Notes / Progress Log

- 2025-06-14: Steps 1–4 completed and tested. SUMO engine implemented and tested. Ready for optimizer and objectives.
- Add a date or initials after each `[x]` if you want to track who/when.
